# Project Description

In this project, I performed sentiment analysis on customer reviews of Starlink products sourced from [Jumia](https://www.jumia.co.ke/catalog/productratingsreviews/sku/BR269EA1PRKULNAFAMZ/), an e-commerce platform in Kenya. By extracting, cleaning, and analyzing the reviews using Python, I transformed raw customer feedback into actionable insights, highlighting key strengths and areas for improvement. The analysis involved natural language processing (NLP) techniques, data visualization, and word cloud generation to summarize customer sentiment.

## Tools and Libraries Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: requests, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`, `nltk`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `TextBlob`, `wordcloud`, `csv`
Key Tasks and Insights:
Data Extraction and Cleaning:
I scraped reviews from multiple pages of Jumia using `BeautifulSoup` and saved the data into a CSV file for further analysis. The text was preprocessed by removing unwanted characters and stopwords to improve sentiment accuracy.

## Sentiment Analysis:

Employed VADER and TextBlob sentiment analyzers to compute polarity scores (positive, negative, and neutral) and subjectivity levels for each review.
Results revealed a predominantly positive sentiment among customers, indicating satisfaction with Starlink services.
Visualization and Exploration:

Created histograms to visualize the spread of sentiments and bar charts comparing aggregate positive and negative scores.
Generated word clouds for positive and negative reviews to identify recurring themes and customer priorities.
Key Findings:

Customers praised the fast internet speeds, easy installation, and reliable service.
Areas for improvement included the high cost and occasional signal obstructions due to environmental factors.
This project underscores my expertise in web scraping, sentiment analysis, and data visualization to extract meaningful insights from customer feedback.

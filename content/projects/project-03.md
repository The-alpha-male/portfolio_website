# Project Description

This project focuses on developing an interactive CO2 Emission Dashboard using Python and the `Panel` library. It allows users to explore global CO2 emissions from 1750 to 2021, segmented by continent and specific sources like coal, oil, and gas. The dashboard includes visualizations like `line charts`, `scatterplots`, and `bar charts` , along with interactive widgets for real-time data exploration.

- Data Preparation: I imported and cleaned CO2 emissions data, filling missing values and creating additional columns like GDP per capita to enrich the dataset for better analysis. I ensured data accuracy by processing and grouping it based on countries, continents, and years.

- Interactive Exploration: I enabled users to interactively explore CO2 emission trends over time by building widgets like year sliders and radio buttons. Users can select specific continents, view CO2 emissions per capita, and analyze how emissions change based on economic activity.

- Visualization: I created dynamic visualizations using hvPlot, including line charts to track emissions over time, scatterplots comparing CO2 emissions to GDP per capita, and bar charts showing the breakdown of CO2 emissions by source (coal, oil, gas) for different continents.

- Dashboard Design: The dashboard, built using the Panel library, offers an intuitive layout with sidebars for settings and a main display for interactive plots and tables. This dashboard allows for real-time exploration of carbon emissions data, providing crucial insights into global climate change trends and fostering data-driven solutions.

This project reflects my skills in data science, dashboard creation, and interactive visualization to bring critical climate data to life.
